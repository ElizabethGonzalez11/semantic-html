## Challenges
One of the challenges that I faced was adding a screenshot to this README file. I also found it overwhelming when attempting to identify the CSS for each area after changing to sematic HTML. 

## What I learned
I learned to break down the work into  smaller problems and working each section. 
I also learned to save my work regularly and to push to Github as changes were made and using console to double check specific parts of my code.
